I am constrained however to withold most of the details for now. But in summary the invested funds are in a bank in western Europe, we need to terminate this investments and re-profile the funds over to you for certain reasons. This is due to the major shake ups and on going economic re-structuring policy in Russia presently. This is a legitimate transaction, if we are agreed on the terms you will be paid 10% for "re- profiling and subsequent management of the funds" .  If you are interested, please write back by email to: st_fielding_barr@yahoo.com
