Dear Friend,

My name is Dr.  Musa Dura, a staff of FINANCIAL TRUST BANK. I have this 
urgent deal to transact with you if you can do it. There is an unclaimed 
deposited fund of $87.6 Million dollars in the name of Mr James Johnson with 
no traceable address. This fund has stayed over 10 years in the bank without 
a claimant.

Professionally, any unclaimed money for a period exceeding 10 years is 
recovered by the bank. I being in the position of the file. I wants any 
foreign partner to assume the next of kin of the late James Johnson and 
write to the Financial Trust Bank for claims.

I will advice you adequately on how to do it when I hear from you. Bear in 
mind that I will stand as a neutral body to the whole transaction. You will 
only be dealing with any attorney we choose.
Your compensation has been taken into consideration as the account provider. 
To be precise, your share is 30% of the Total amount. Any financial 
assistance we receive from you will be paid back to you immediately the fund 
gets into your account.

I am willing to give you the details of the money and the way we can execute 
the deal successfully but let me see the desire from you  first.


Dr. Musa  Dura

NOTE: YOUR URGENT AND FAVORABLE RESPONSE IS HIGHLY APPRECIATED
