From: Mrs. Rose D. Aboka,

Greetings in the name of God. Please let this not sound strange to you. I=
 am=20
deaf and suffering from a long time cancer of the bream! set which also=20
affected my brain, from all indication my conditions is really deteriorat=
ing=20
and it is quite obvious that according to my doctors they have advised me=
=20
that I may not live for the next six months, this is because the cancer=20
stage has gotten to a very bad stage. I was brought upfrom a motherless=20
baby&#65533;s home, married to my late husband for twenty years without a=
=20
child. My husband died in a fatal motor accident.Before his death we were=
=20
true Christians.

Since his death I decided not to re-marry, I sold all my inherited=20
belongings and deposited the sum of US$3 million dollars with a Security=20
Company here in Abidjan. Presently this money is still with them and the=20
management just wrote me as the true owner to come forward to receive the=
=20
money or issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my=20
behalf since I can not come over because of my illness. Presently I'm wit=
h=20
my lap top in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for cance=
r=20
of the lungs. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have to=
ld=20
me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see that=20
this money is invested to any organization of your choice and distributed=
=20
each year among the charity organization, the poor and the motherless=20
baby&#65533;s home where I come from. I want you God fearing to also use=20
this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows.

If you are interested, please respond back to my proposal so that I will=20
give you security firm contact, They will issue you the letter of authori=
ty=20
that will prove you as the new beneficiary of this fund. Please assure me=
=20
that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.
