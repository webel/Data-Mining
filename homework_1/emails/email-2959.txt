Cocody Abidjan-Cote D'Ivoire

My Dear,


I am Mark james, the only Son of late Mr and Mrs James. My father was a very 
wealthy cocoa Farmer and cocoa merchant before he was killed to death by his 
pollitical associates on one of their outing to make pollitical dialoug. 
When my mother died on the 21st October 1994, my father took me and my 
younger sister special because we are motherless.

Before the death of my father on 2nd Feb 2004 in a private hospital He 
secretly called me on his bedside and told me that he has a sum of $10.5m 
(Ten Million, five hundred thousand dollars) left in a suspense account in
a local Bank in Abidjan, the capital of cote d ivorie that he used my name 
as his ONLY Son for the next of kin in deposit of the fund.

He also explained to me that I should seek for a God fearing foreign partner 
in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use
it for investment purpose, (such as real estate management).  Sir, we are 
honourably seeking your assistance in the following ways.

1) To provide a Bank account where this money would be transferred to.
2) To serve as the guardian of this since I am a smail boy Moreover Sir,
we are willing to offer you 20% of the sum as compensation for effort input
after the successful transfer of this fund to your designate account 
overseas. Anticipating to hear from you soon.
Thanks and God Bless.

Best regards.
Mark james
