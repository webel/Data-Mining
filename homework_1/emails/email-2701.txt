Dearest
 

My name is Miss Angela Kote. an orphan to the late former minister of finance in Sierra Leone Dr. Thomas kote who died as a result of rebel attack during one of their peace keeping forum in the year 2003. I inherited a total sum of $8.5 million US dollars from my late parents. 
This money which is concealed in a metallic trunk box is deposited with a security and finance company in Ivory Coast under a secret arrangement as a family treasure. This means that the security company does not know the real 
content of this box that was deposited in their security costody.
My main purpose of sending you this mail is because of the way I found you and perhaps trustworthy to give this priority of shipping this box of money to any address that you think is very secured and safe in place with your percentage of which we shall chat on soon. I will come over to your country to continue my education as soon as the funds is claimed by you. 
There is need for urgent action because I am paying US $45 dollars per day as a demurrage charges to the security company for keeping this consignment. I give thanks immensely for the co-operation as I look forward to hear from you soonest.

You can still mail me on this address angkote@yahoo.com

Best Regard
Angela Kote
