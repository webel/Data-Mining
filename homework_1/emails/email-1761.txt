Hello,
My name is DAVID ELLIS, a nationality of United
Kingdom,I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.
It has defiled allforms of medical treatment, and
right now I have only about a few months to live,
according to medical experts.I have notparticularly
lived my life so well, as I never really cared for
anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am
very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile
to people and only focused on my business as that was
the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this
as I now know that there is more to life than just
wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I
believe when God gives me a second chance to come to
this world I would live my life a different way from
how I have lived it.
Now that God has called me, I have willed and given
most of my property and assets to my immediate and
extended familymembers as well as a few close
friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my
soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth.
So far, I have distributed money to some charity
organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia.
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot
do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my
family to close one of my accounts and distribute the
money which I have there to charity organization in
Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money
to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left
for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge
cash deposit of Twenty Eight Million USD that I have
with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want
you to help me collect this deposit and despatch it to
charity organizations.
I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.
God be with you.
DAVID ELLIS
