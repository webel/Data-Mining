Good day,

My name is david ojoh.I am a 21yrs old student. My father was a Timber and
COCOA merchant . He was poisoned to death by his business associates on one 
of their outings on a business trip.

My mother died when we were young and before the death of our father on
15th October, 2004 in a private hospital , he called me on his bed side and 
told me of a secret deposit he made with one of the prime deposit and 
security Company in Abidjan-Cote D'Ivoire.

He deposited the sum of Ten Million, five hundred thousand United State
Dollars.(USD$10.500,000) in a box and declare it as African Arts which he
told me that he used my name as the next of Kin for the box deposit.
He also explained to me that it was because of his wealth that he was
poisoned by his busines associates. He advised me to seek for whom I can 
confide in to transfer the fund for onward investment. I am willing to offer 
you a reasonable amount of this money as compensation for your efforts to 
retrieve the box from the security office and transfer the money into your 
nominated Bank account.

I would like you to send me your telephone and fax numbers for easy
communication so that I can also send you the documents that covers the 
deposit of the trunk box.

I am waiting for your kind response.

Your's Sincerely,
david ojoh.
