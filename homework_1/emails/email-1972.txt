FAMILY BUSINESS PROPOSAL
Johannesburg, South Africa 
From:Williams 
Kabila
Dear ,

This letter might surprise you because we have met 
neither in person nor by correspondence. I got your contact through 
some discreet inquiry from the chamber of commerce and industry; one 
has no doubt in your ability to handle a financial business 
transaction. 

However, I wish to introduce myself, I am Williams 
Kabila the son of the late Democratic Republic of Congo President 
Laurent Desire Kabila of the blessed memory. I know this letter might 
come to you as a surprise but I honestly do not intend to I write this 
Letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of US$28M (Twenty- 
Eight Million United State Dollars) with 
you. 

Once I get your 
responds, I will flourish you with details on how to go about this 
transaction

Best Regards, 

Williams KABILA (forthe family)
