West- Africa.


My name is Mr. Balarabe Zamani, the Manager, credit and foreign bills  of ECOWAS BANK LIMITED  Lome Togo .I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number D14-A55-096/utb/t who perished in a plane crash[Ethiopian airline 961] with the whole passengers aboard.

Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of usd.28.5 m, [twenty-eight million five hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. 
       
On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up  to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than Eight  years, because money will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period.   In view of this I got your contact through a search on the internet .I  shall   give you 40% of the total sum .

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and thatyou should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the
deceased.

When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying Your decision including your privatetel/ fax numebrs for quick communication. 

Respectfully submitted,

MR.Balarabe   Zamani
Manager, Credit and Foreign Bills
