ATTN  PLS;

Recently over the BBC radio and tv you 
might be watching and hearing on the 
media , issue partaining to my family.
 
I am Mrs J. Taylor the Wife of the Formal 
liberian president Charles Taylor Who 
has been in exile to (Nigeria) a country 
in West African since the political unrest 
in the liberian country, My  Husband  
has been in the West African Country for 
an assylom,but of recent the United 
Nation (UN) demanded that he should 
be tried befor the liberian court of law 
he has been reminded.
 
Right now,the life of mine and all my 
family is not certain the nation is 
treatning to treat my family in an 
un-Godly manner.
 
 Please first and formost, I need your 
assistant to help my helpless family to 
secure this part of my family account, 
hence some of my  Husbands account 
has been frozeen by the present 
administration.
 
However, my family decided to search 
for a good samaritan like you who can 
help to secure this sum of $30.270,000,00 
(thirty million two and seventy 
thounsand) (US) dollars.
 
 Which is rightly kept in an unsecured 
enviroment,I belive you are the only one 
who can help in securing this fund to 
avoid it from been discorvered and 
confisticated by this present administration, 
my family promise to reward you with 
20% of this found after you recieve it I
 pray God will reward you as you see 
my family through from this situation.
 
Please reply to: jeandcine@yahoo.co.uk
as soon as you recieve this email
 
Thanks and God Bless
 Mrs Jewel Taylor.
