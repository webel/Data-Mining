>From The Desk Of Dr Solomon Richards
MD/CEO Financial Consultant,
Federal Republic Of Nigeria. 

ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO

 I have interest of investing in your country as such I decided to establish contact with you for assistance as soon as I am able to transfer my funds for this investment, which is already with a Security Company in Europe.

There are two basic things I would want you to assist me in; 

(1) Helping me as a front to collect these consignment/funds from the security company in Europe. 

This is because of my inability to   travel out of the country, which I am taking refuge at the moment with my wife and children, which I will explain better to you upon the receipt of your acceptance.

(2) Helping me to carry out feasibility study on areas/choice of investment you deem best for me.

I retired as financial consultant and was the last personal financial adviser to the ex- head of state before his demise and have no intention of carrying out any further investment programmed in my country for security reasons. 

Note: If you cannot travel to Europe for then clearing of the consignment, I can still make an arrangement for the delivering of the consignment to your doorstep through my attorney.

Enclosing your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.

You can call me as soon as you receive this proposal for more information. 
 
Thanks,
Yours sincerely,
Dr Solomon Richards
