<P>Good Day,</P>=0D
<P>I am a staff of NatWest Bank London. I am writing following an<BR>
oppurtunity in my office that will be of imense benefit to both of us. In m=
y<BR>
department we discovered an abandoned sum of =C2=A326.5million British Poun=
ds<BR>
Sterling (Twenty Six million five hundred thousand British Pounds) in an<BR>
account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris <BR>
Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of<=
BR>
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000,including<BR>
his wife and only daughter. </P>=0D
<P>Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his<BR>
next of kin or relatves to come over and claim his money because we cannot<=
BR>
&nbsp;release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation =
to<BR>
&nbsp;the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. </P>=0D
<P>Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only<BR>
daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the<BR>
knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this<BR>
discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to<=
BR>
make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or<B=
R>

nt<BR>
&nbsp;since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back=
<BR>
into Government treasury as unclaimed bill.</P>=0D
<P>The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained<=
BR>
&nbsp;after five years the money will be transferred into banking treasury =
as<BR>
&nbsp;unclaimed funds.</P>=0D
<P>We agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign<BR>
partner,while the balance will be for me and my colleagues.I will visit you=
r<BR>
country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above o=
nce<BR>
&nbsp;this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me and trust i=
