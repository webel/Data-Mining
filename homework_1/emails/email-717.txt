HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO CHANGED MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER 
COUNTRIES INTO OTHER FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE 
NEW HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT KABILA HAS MADE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE 
SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE 
HUSBAND'STREASURES DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. 

HENCE MY CHILDREN AND IDECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE 
SITUATION TILL WHEN THINGS GETBETTER, LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS 
DEAD AND THE SON TAKING OVER(JOSEPH KABILA). 

ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANC EWAS CONFISCATED BY 
THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY IDENTITY SO THAT 
MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND CONFISCATED. 

I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM OF THIRTY MLLION UNITED STATE DOLLAR 
(USD$18,000,000,00.)WITH A SECURITY COMPANY ,FOR SAFEKEEPING. 
THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING THE CONTENT.

US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO 
THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON (SONNY) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIE

I WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY,BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY 
IDENTITY REVEALED.I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN 
MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND NON-SPECULATIVE 
INVESTMENTS. 

MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASISE THE HIGHLEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY, WHICH 
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND 
CONFIDENCE,WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU.
