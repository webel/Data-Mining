I discovered a dormant account in my office, as Group finance director 
with Lloyds bank London.It will be in my interest to transfer this 
fund worth $55,000,000(fifty five million dollars) in an 
accountoffshore. If you can be a collaborator to this please indicate 
interest immediately for us to proceed. Remember this is absolutely 
confidential. My husband does not know about his risk taking.
 
My 
family will be in shambles if it burst out and i will also be in 
trouble aswell as loose my precious job. Your contact phone numbers 
and name will be necessary for this effect.
 
Regards and respect,
 
Cynthia Wood and Helen Weir.
