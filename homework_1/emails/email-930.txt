Att:

Please kindly accept this offer with your full heart.

With warm heart I offer you my friendship, and I hope that this mail
meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this letter might
seem to you as we have not meet personally or had any dealings in the
past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and
immense benefit.

I am the only son of Dr Fedel C.Mumbaza from Sierra Leone. I am 22 years
old. My late father, Dr Fedel C.Mumbaza was a native of Mende district in
the Northern province of Sierra Leone, he was the ex-general Manager of
Sierra Leone mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown.

He died as a result of a car accident ,(may his soul rest in peace) but
before he died ,He disclosed to me and my brother that he deposited the
sum of ( $13.4,000 000.00)thirteen Million Four Hundred Thousand United
State Dollars in a private security company in Ivory coast, that the money
was meant for the Cocoa export-business he wanted to establish
in Abidjan,Ivory coast.

Although according to my father he deposited the money in a private
security company, but he decleard it as Artcraft/Family valuables, He
gave us the documents for the claims,
(1)deposit certificates (2)Reciepts of payments,(3)Agreement papers.and

ask us to look for investors that will stand as his foreign business
partner.

I have arrived in Abidjan (Ivory coast) located the security company
and comfirmed the (safe) metallic trunk box.

Now with most honest and confidentiality I are soliciting your
assistance in the following ways:

(1)To stand as the foreign business partner of my late father(business
assocate) so that we can retrieve the box (safe)from the security.

(3) To move the money to your country for further investment.

Feel free, if you may have any questions to ask. Meanwhile I will offer
you 10% of the total sum .



Thank you and May Almigty God bless you for your kind assistance.

Micheal Mumbaza
