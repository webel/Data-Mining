My name is Dr. Michael Kaba., 
and I work in the International operation department in a Local Bank 
here in South Africa On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant 
domiciliary account with a BAL. Of 42,000,000 (Forty-two Million USD) 
on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account 
holder has long since passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the 
account.

The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the 
former operator of the a/c is a foreigner in particular and I am 
certainly sure that he is dead,because the the death was recorded by 
department of home affair and nobody will come again for the claim of 
this money A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to 
the account Holder;therefore I need your cooperation in this 
transaction.

I will provide the necessary information needed in order 
to claim this money, But you will need to open an account or provide an 
existing account information where this can be transferred.
If 
interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax number including 
full details of the account to beused for the Deposit. 

Bank 
Name/Address:.............
A/C Number:...........
A/C Name:............
Swift Code:.........(if any).

I want to assure you that the 
transaction is without risk if due process is followed accordingly. 
Finally, I will give you 40% for your corporation 55% will be for me, 
while the remaining 5% will be for reimbursement of expenses both 
parties might incur during the process of the transaction.

I look 
forward to a favorable response from you if you are intrested to do 
this business with me

Yours faithfully & God Bless You.

Dr. Michael 
Kaba.
