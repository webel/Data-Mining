ATTN: DID YOU GET MY E-MAIL?

My Name is Mr. Nelson Brown, a senior 
Auditor Heading computing department here in our bank.

On my routine 
inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a Balance of 
( THIRTY FIVE MILLION POUNDS ONLY}  I have only written to seek your 
indulgence and assistance in transfering this fund.

I am proposing to 
make this transfer to a designated bank account of your choice. Thus, i 
need your indulgence and support,as your share will be 25% of the total 
transfer sum after the transfer has been  successfully concluded, 5% 
will be set aside for any expenses that both of us might incure during 
the transfer and 5% will be devoted for charity.

Let me know if you 
can handle it. 
Best Regards, 
Mr Nelson Brown.
