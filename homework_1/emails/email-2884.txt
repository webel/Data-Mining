Dear friend,
Compliments, Salam Alaykum!

I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance departmen=
t=20
of
BANK OF AFRICA.

I am writting to seek your coperation over this business deal.
In my department, I discovered an abandoned sum of$30.million
USD(THIRTYmillion US dollars)only , in an account that belongs to one of =
our
foreign customers who died along with his entire family in a plane crash=20
that took
place in Kenya,East Africa,the Late DR. GEORGE BRUMLEY,a citizen of=20
Atlanta,United
States of America but naturalised in Burkinafaso,West Africa and contract=
or=20
with
ECOWAS,(ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES) .

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next=
 of
kin to come over and claim his money because it cannot be released unless
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as=20
indicated in
our banking guidelines but unfortunately , all his supposed next of kin o=
r
relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind=
=20
for the
claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to makethis
businness proposal to you and release the money to you via your foreign b=
ank
account as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and=20
subsequent
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and this money Could go into t=
he=20
Bank
treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money
remainedunclamed after four years, the money will betransfered into the B=
ank
treasury as unclaimed fund.The request for your assistance and maximum
co-operation as a foreign citizen to stand as the next of kin in this=20
business
is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner and =
a
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

40 % of this money will be for you as my foreign partner, inrespect to th=
e
provision of a foreign account. 10 %will be set aside for expences incure=
d=20
during
the business and 50 % would be for me.There after I will come over to you=
r=20
country
for disbursement accoding to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as
arranged,you must apply first to the bank as the relation or next of kin =
to=20
the
deceased,indicating your claims and wherein the money will be remitted .

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text o=
f
application which you will fill and submit to the office of the foreign=20
remittance
director of the bank of africa. I will not fail to bring to your notice t=
