REPLY ME.From Robin Shephard

I write to request your co-operation in 
my desire to find a foreign partner who  will assist me in the 
relocation and investment of the sum of  US $40million,which is 
presently available and in my possession. 

Presently, I am a serving 
government functionary in my Native Country. The money was realised 
from gratification/kickbacks which was received from foreign 
contractors who executed contracts for my country in the last 2 years.

I am unable to travell out now,so i shall be glad if you can stand 
asbeneficiary to receive this money abroad,and also nominate a good 
investment facility in your country where the fund will be placed,for 
profits making.

I am offering you 35% of total sum after the ransfer.
The entire plan and documents of this transaction will be forwarded to 
you as soon as i receive your positive response. I also want to assure 
you that there is no risk attach to you in this business.

MR Robin 
Shephard.
