Dear Friend,

My name is ANTHONY ELUMELU, the Managing Director of STANDARD TRUST 
BANK PLC. I am using this medium to solicite for your assistant 
regarding FUND TRANSFER ABROAD. At my disposal, I have an over-invoiced 
sum of $25m USD (Twenty Five Million United State Dollars) which can 
only be claim by a foreigner. This fund came as a result of over-
invoiced cost of the Rehabilitation and Renovation of Passport 
Immigration Offices in Lagos, handled by a German Contractor WOLFGANG 
POHL ENGINEERING GMBH, GERMANY; and after receiving payment, the left 
over could only be claim by an alien citizen. Hence, I want you to make 
this claim so that the fund could be release to your chosen account 
abroad where I will join you for onward disbursement. I have all the 
necessary certified back-up documentations that will prove you as the 
ownership of the fund. You will be receiving 35% of the said fund for 
your assistance, 60% will be mine as the initiator of this business 
while 5% will be use for any expenses that may be incur as this 
transaction progresses either from telephone bills or fax messages.
As soon as you receive this message, indicated your interest by sending 
me your telephone and fax number through my direct email 
tonystb@walla.com for effective communication.
I look forward working with you.

Best regards,
MR. ANTHONY ELUMELU
MD (STB)
