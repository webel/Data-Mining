farm from us. My father was murdered in Zimbabwean and I and my mother

for any place abroad. My fund is presently deposited with a Security
Company without disclosing the contents of the box to the Security Firm,
and I would like you to 
 
Help me transfer this money overseas pending investment. The amount
deposited is (Twenty-Two Million United States Dollars) US$22 Million.
In consideration of your assistance, I agreed to offer you, upon
acceptance to this proposal 30% the remaining 70% will be for me and my
mother for our life investment in your country.
