Dear sir,

Greetings to you and yourfamily. I will need your assistance in investing in 
your country. Real Estate and importation into my country. But due to my 
position as a civil servant I will need someone to assist me with this as my 
job right now will conflict with my investment plans. 

If you are sure you can be of assistance to me please send me your 
confidential and direct email address, telephone and fax numbers so that
I can 
intimate you further on this transaction. I need someone that is trust
worthy. 
If you know you cannot be trusted please donot reply to my mail. But if
you are 
absolutely sure we can work together, then I promise you a handsome
reward and 
this will be detailed to you confidentially and an agreement will be
reached by 
both parties. i.e you and me. 

I will like you to please keep this transaction absolutely confidential
as I am 
a top government fuctunary in my country and we are not allowed to
transact any 
foreign transaction as long as we are still in active government service. 

Please reply to my mail immediately. 

Regards, 
Mr.solo chuks.
