Dear friend, 

I apollogize in advance if this mail comes as an embarrassment because of so many things that happens in our times. I am Isaac Baka, the site inspection director with the ministry ofworks and construction and I worked directly with the Minister in charge of the Ministry here in Republic of Sudan.
   
I awarded a contract to a firm worth several millions of dollars a few years ago. In the course of executing the project the firm discovered large gold deposit in one of the construction sites. Being the site director I collaborated with the firm in the mining of the gold on a mutual agreement to share the proceeds out of which I got a share of 7.5 Million. 

As a civil servant in this small war torn country, I cannot introduce this funds into the banking system here considering my meager monthly income as well as the code of conduct guidelines regulating civil service here in my country, Sudan. Presently Sudan is engulfed in a civil crisis and as this crisis intensified by the day, I have decided to move this fund out for any profitable venture. The fund will be moved out of Sudan under diplomatic cover as soon as we conclude all procedure.

I therefore solicit for your co-operation to take delivery of this fund into your custody for any profitable investment that will be mutually beneficial. I will be able to arrange all necessary procedures to ensure smooth movement of this funds until you are in control of it.  

Please let me know if you are interested by return mail to be sent to: (isbaka@myway.com, isbaka@sify.com). Also include your full names and contact telephone number to enable me call you. I will provide you with more information as soon as you indicate appreciable interest to deal. 

Regards,
ISAAC BAKA.
