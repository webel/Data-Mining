or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty 
a/c can serve as far as it can receive money.

I am Mr IBRAHIM MUSTAPHA an accountant and personal confidant to Dr. 
Ravindra F. Shah who died together with his wife Dr.Mrs.Manjula Parikh-Shah 
in a plane crash on the 1st Oct. 2003 on their way to attend wedding in 
Boston. Mr. Ravindra F. Shah, is an American, a physician and industrialist, 
he died without having any beneficiary to his assets including his account 
here in Burkina Faso which he opened in the year 2000 as his personal 
savings for the purpose of expansion and developement of his
company before his untimely death in 2003.The amount involved 
i(USD39,500,000.00)ThirtyNine Million Five Hundred Thousand USD, no other 
person knows about this
account. I am contacting you for us to transfer this funds to your account

FiveHundred Thousand USD) from this money into a safe account abroad, after 
which we will transfer the
remaining (30M)but I don't know any foreigner. I amonly contacting you as a 
foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person 
here,without valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved 
to any foreigner with valid international passport ordrivers license and 
foreign a/c because the money is in US Dollars and
the former owner of the a/c Mr.Ravindra F. Shah is a foreigner too, and as
