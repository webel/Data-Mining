 his 
family

3years ago.

When he was writing his will, he disclosed to me about a 
fixed deposit 
of GP5.2Million with a bank here in Uk, with orders on 
how it should be
 
shared between his wife and kids if anything happens

here to 
locate any of his relatives to come and lay claim to his 
estate has not
 
been possible and In Great Britian fund that are 
unclaimable after six 
years will be returned to Her Majesty.

to make you stand in as a relative to this man and If you are 
interested please reply me so that I will educate you on how I have 
planned to execute this and also discuss on how we are going to share 
the funds. Pls send your reply to mym private address
