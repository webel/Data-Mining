DEAR FRIEND,

I GUESS THIS LETTER MAY COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE
SINCE I HAD NO PREVIOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH YOU.
I AM THE CHAIRMAN OF INDEPENDENT NATIONAL
ELECTORAL COMMISSION (INEC) I GOT YOUR CONTACT IN THE
COURSE OF MY SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE PERSON WITH WHOM TO
HANDLE A VERY CONFIDENTIAL TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE
TRANSFER OF FUND VALUED THIRTY MILLION UNITED STATES
DOLLARS ($30M) TO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT.

THE ABOVE FUND IN QUESTION IS NOT CONNECTED WITH ARMS,
DRUGS OR MONEY LAUNDERING. IT IS THE PRODUCT OF OVER
INVOICE ON CONTRACT AWARDED IN JANUARY 2003 BY INEC,
TO A FOREIGN COMPANY FOR THE SUPPLY OF ELECTORAL MATERIALS
THAT WAS USED FOR CONDUCTING APRIL/MAY, 2003 
ELECTIONS.

THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN EXECUTED AND PAYMENT OF THE
ACTUAL CONTRACT AMOUNT MADE TO THE FOREIGN CONTRACTOR
LEAVING THE BALANCE OF $30M U.S DOLLARS IN A DORMANT
ACCOUNT WHICH MY COLLEAGUES AND I NOW WANT TO TRANSFER
OUT OF NIGERIA INTO A RELIABLE FOREIGN ACCOUNT FOR
OUR PERSONAL USE.

AS CIVIL SERVANTS, WE DO NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY
FOREIGN ACCOUNT MACHINERY TO SUCCESSFULLY HANDLE THIS
TRANSACTION. THERFORE IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO SOURCE
FOR A FOREIGN COMPANY WITH THE CAPABILITY TO ACT AS
THE ORIGINAL BENEFICIARY OF THE CONTRACT.

MY DEAR, IT IS A GOOD THING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS
ENDORSED THE RESOLUTION PASSED BY THE SENATE THAT ALL
FOREIGN CONTRACTORS OWED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF
NIGERIA SHOULD BE PAID, WE WILL SEIZE THIS GOOD
OPPORTUNITY TO PURPORT YOU AS ONE OF THE BENEFICIARIES
TO BE PAID.

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS PROPOSAL KINDLY EMAIL TO
ME YOUR LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE ALONG WITH YOUR DIRECT
TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS, BUT IF YOU CANNOT FOR ANY
REASON HANDLE THIS TRANSACTION I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL IF
YOU CAN INTRODUCE IT TO A RELIABLE AND TRUST WORTHY
PERSON IN WHICH IN ANY CASE YOUR INTEREST WILL BE
PROPERLY TAKEN CARE OF. 

MEANWHILE, MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE DECIDED TO SHARE
THE MONEY IN THE FOLLOWING RATIO: 70% FOR MY
COLLLEAGUES AND I, THEN 25% FOR YOU THE ACCOUNT OWNER
AND 5% FOR ALL LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL EXPENSES THAT
MAY ARISE IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRANSACTION.
FUTHER DETAILS ABOUT THIS TRANSACTION WILL BE
DISCUSSED IN THE SUBSEQUENT CORRESPONDENCE.

THIS TRANSACTION IS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUT 100%
RISK FREE. NOTE ALSO THAT THE PARTICULAR NATURE OF
YOUR BUSINESS IS IRRELEVANT TO THIS TRANSACTION AND
THIS TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO BE CONCLUDED WITHIN 15
WORKING DAYS SINCE ALL LOCAL CONTACTS AND ARRANGEMENTS
HAVE BEEN PROPERLY PERFECTED FOR A SMOOTH AND
SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION. IF THIS
PROPOSAL IS ACCEPTABLE BY YOU, PLEASE CONFIRM YOUR INTEREST VIA
THIS EMAIL ADDRESS 

YOURS FAITHFULLY,

SIR ABEL IBUDE GUOBADIA
