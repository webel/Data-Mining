Dear sir, 

I am Mr Bruno Williams. Credit management and recovery manager with the Bank 
of Africa - Benin, I was personal account manager to one late Engineer Pascal 
Lent, who till his death was a contractor with shell Development Company 
. 
On the 21st of April 1999, Engr. Pascal, his wife and their three children 
were involved in a car accident along Port Novo express road and all occupants 
of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. 

At the time of his death, he had a deposit of $8.6 Million which was proceed 
of a contract work he just concluded with Shell. The payment was made with 
a (Bank) cheque which I personally cleared. 
Unfortunately, till this moment no person has come as his relation for his 
chattels with us. I humbly request your attention to this matter so that 
I can present you as his next of kin and beneficiary to his chattels. It 
is not a very difficult thing to do and it will not take time. All I will 
Need is to change the name and particulars of his next of kin to yours in 
our computer database and we file in an application for the release of the 
fund. 

Please contact me on this email address as quickly as possible brunowilliams01@yahoo.com <mailto:brunowilliams01@yahoo.com> 
I will give you my private phone number as soon as we open contact. For 
now please reply only through this address. Do keep every bit of this operation 
absolutely 
Confidential. 

Finally, your share will be 25% of the total. 
Expecting your urgent response. 
Regards 
Bruno Williams
