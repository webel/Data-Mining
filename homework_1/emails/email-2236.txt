Dear sir,

I am Mr. Kevin Woodgate, an attorney at law. A deceased
client of mine, by name Mr. Andrew Parker, who hereinafter
shall be referred to as my client, died as a result of
a heart-related condition in November 2002. I have contacted
you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client
before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank
where this deposit valued at 45 million dollars is lodged.

This bank has issued me a notice to contact the next of kin, or
the account will be confiscated because there is a government
gazzette/mandate/authorising all banks to freeze or consificate
any account that has not been servicable in a long period of time,
this is geared towards capital flight for the economy.

My proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you as
the next-of-kin and beneficiary of my named client, so that the
proceeds of this account can be paid to you, then we can share
the amount on a mutually agreed-upon percentage. All legal documents
to back up your claim as my client's next-of-kin will be provided.

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this
transaction through. This will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

If this business proposition offends your moral values, do accept my
apology but if not, then contact me at once to indicate your interest,
by giving me your telephone number, fax number and your address.

Kindly reply to: kevinwoodgate@4x.ro
Regards,

Barrister Kevin Woodgate.
