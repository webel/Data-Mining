Dear Sir, 
I am Wright Gilbson in London, my Late client an expatriate was Killed 
in an unknown circumstance and before his death, deposited a 
consignment containing $7,500,000.00 U.S Dollars with a vault Company

very difficult for me before those consignments get confiscated or 
declared unserviceable by the vault company because they have given me

This is why I am writing to you so that I will assist you claim this 
consignment. I will prepare every operation that will assist your 
claim. 
The consignment will be released to you within 12 working days after 
you have filed in for claims. I will like you to acknowledge the 
receipt 
of this e-mail as soon as possible via my email with the following 
information: 
(1) Your full name. 
(2) Home or office address.

I look forward to your quick reply.
