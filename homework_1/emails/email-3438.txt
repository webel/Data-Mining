Manager Bill And Exchange Dept
African Development Bank(ADB)
Ouagadougou Burkina Faso.

Dear Friend,

I know that this mail will come to you as a  surprise. I am the bill ad 
exchange manager in African Development Bank .I Hoped that you  will not 
expose or  betray this trust and confident that i am about to repose on you 
for the mutual benefit of our both families.

I need your urgent assistance in transferring the  sum of $11.3 million 
immediately to your account. The money has been  dormant for years in our 
Bank  here without any body coming for it. The owner of this account is 
JOSEPH F. GRILLO, foreigner and he is the Manager Of petrol chemical 
service, a chemical engineer by Profession. He died in world trade center as 
a victim of the September 11,2001 Incident that befall the United State of 
America, the bank has made series of efforts to contact any of the relatives 
to claim this money but without success, you can confirm through this 
website:

I don't want the money to go into our Bank treasury  as an abandoned  fund. 
So this is the reason why i contacted you ,so that  the bank  can  release 
the  money to you as the nearest person to the deceased  customer. Please i 
will like you to keep this proposal as a top secret and  delete if you are 
not interested.
Upon receipt of your reply I will send you full  details on how the business 
  will be executed and also note that you will have  40% of the above 
mentioned  sum if you agree to transact the business with me.
