me in transferring the sum of $15,000,000 (Fifteen Million United States 
Dollars) inherited from my father late Mr. Bob Kenneth to your country 
for investment. I am motivated in contacting you and hope to gradually 
build trust, relationship and confidence in you as I get to know you 
better.
 
So please I want to know if you will be of assistance but first I want to 
get to know you better. I am willing to offer you $3,000,000(Three 
Million United States Dollars) for your effort input after the successful

Kindly indicate your interest towards assisting me by sending your 
telephone and fax number, the name of your bank where you want the money 
to be tranferred, your account number, your occupation, marital statue, 
your house address and a copy of your international passport so that I 
can forward them to the bank and introduce you as my late father's 
foreign business partner for them to commence on the tranfer without 
delay.
