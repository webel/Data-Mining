NOTIFICATION OF BEQUEST

On behalf of the Trustees and Executor of the estate of Late Engr. Reinhard
Hermann, I once again try to notify you as my earlier letter returned
undelivered. I hereby attempt to reach you again by this same email address
on the WILL.

I wish to notify you that late Engr. Reinhard Hermann made you beneficiary
to his WILL.
He left the sum of seven million five hundred thousand United States
Dollars ($7,500.000.00 USD) to you in the codicil and last testament to his
WILL.

This may sound strange and unbelievable to you, but it is real and true.
Being a widely traveled man, he must have been in contact with you in the
past or simply you were recommended to him by one of his numerous friends
abroad who wished you good.
Engr. Reinhard Hermann until his death was a member of the Helicopter
Society and the Institute of Electronic & Electrical Engineers. He had a
very good heart and was a philanthropist.

His great philanthropy earned him numerous awards during his life time.
Late Engr. Reinhard Hermann died on the 13th day of December, 2004 at the
age of 80 years, and his WILL is now ready for execution.
According to him this money is to support your humanitarian activities and
to help the poor and the needy in our society.
Please if I reach you this time as I am hopeful, endeavor to get back to me
as soon as possible to enable me conclude my job.
I hope to hear from you in no distant time.

Sincerely yours,
BARR. LENNART PHILIPSON (ESQ).
