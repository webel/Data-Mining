hello my dear,
my name is aishatu ahmed.my father was recently murdered in tripoli as a result of family and friends conflicts due to a substantial amount he made while he was in the ministry.generally,most rich men keep such fund at their homes as it is illegal for one to keep such amount in any bank in lybia without a proper explaination as per how such fund was made .so these wicked people thought that this fund was still in our mansion and they tried to eliminate all our house hold in order to get free access to our home to search for it  unknowing to them that my late father had already moved the fund to a finance house in europe through diplomatic means leaving me as the beneficiary as if he forsaw the danger in our family.just one week after his burial,these people broke into our home with gun shots everywhere which resulted to the death of my only little brother.that very night,i and my mother escaped and ran to a country(by road) called burkina faso where we ar!
 e for the moment in a hidden hotel.i got your contact from a consultancy firm here in burkina faso,though i did not let them know my main reason of contacting you for confidential sake as i only told them that i needed your contact for pen pals.i need your faithfully and confidential asistance to get this fund from the finance house in europe as we are financially down due to our unprepared journey to this place,ofwhich we left all our belongings and other valuables for our dear lives hoping to get this money out of the finance house.luckily for us,we came here with all the documents relating to this fund.if you have any question to ask,please feel free to do so and get back to me soonest.
aishatu
