 DEAR,SIR/MADAM
 
 
 Good day, With the good reference of your esteemed
person made by a charity aid volunteer...although I
did not disclose my actual intention of reaching you.
Please do forgive me if this letter may offend you
 without your prior consent.

 
 I am MR,TONY WILLIAMS a Consultant and finance
broker
with West African Consultant Ltd,and also a Sierra
Leonian, currently living here in Accra-Ghana due to
 political instability in my country. I am highly
impressed with your esteem and i wish to introduce my
client to invest in your esteem.
First and foremost, could you enlighten me more about
your investment output if my cleint is said to invest

 the sum of $6.550.000 million (SIX MILLION FIVE
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) in
 your firm and what are the taxes involved for a
foreign investor in your country.
If you accept to receive this money, in your private
or company account, she will reward you with 15% of
the fund. In addition, she will allow your company to

 
 use her own 85% share as a working capital for a
 period of three years at small interest which both
of
you will agree on later.
Finally and most important, kindly let me be rest
assured that you would act on a good faith and never
have the intentions of leading her astray or getting
ambitious. Bye for now and I hope to hear from you
soon.
 
Please replt to(tony_88williams@yahoo.com) 
 
 Best regards,
 
 MR,TONY WILLIAMS
