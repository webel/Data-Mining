Mr. Benlock From (uk)
25 Gresham Street
London EC2V 7HN.
 
In order to 
transfer out ( Twelve million, five
hundred thousand British pounds) 
from our Bank . 
I have the courage to look for a reliable and Honest
Person who will be capable for this important business
Transaction,
believing that you will never let me down
either now or in Future.
 
The owner of this account is Mr. David Hagen foreigner
and the Manager 
Of petrol chemical service,a chemical
engineer by Proffession and he 
died since 1990.
The account has no other beneficiary And my 
Investigation
proved to me as well that his company does not know
anything About this account.
 
I want to transfer this money into a 
safe foreign
account abroad but i Don't know any foreigner,i know
that 
this message will come to you as a surprise as we
don't know ourselves 
before,but be sure that it is
real And A Genuine business.
 
I believe 
in God that you will never let me down in
this transaction,at the 
conclusion of this
business,you will be giving 30% of the total amount,
70% will be for me.
I look forward to your earliest
reply. 
Best 
regards
Benlock
