 
Dear Sir/madam
My name is Mrs. Joy Ibe I, am about to retire from my work before the end of next year. I write to inform you of my intention to invest in Hotel business in  your country and to request you to assists me carrying out feasibility studies on location, type and estimation on how much it will cost to establish a "Three Star Hotel", either by outright purchase of an already existing but dilapidated one and renovate or setting up a new one entirely.

If you sincerely carry out this survey, and give me a feedback as soon as possible,I will give you the power of attorney to build & manage the hotel on my behalf pending my retirement next year.

I am presently down with sickness as a result of my old age and stress but I have been assured by my doctor that I will be fine and back to work soon.
Please do let me know wether you are willing and capable of handling all these.
I will be expecting your reply as soon as possible.
Thanks

Yours sincerely,
Mrs Joy Ibe.
