The federal forces are impressing us badly that we can not have a way to be in the city, all our contacts closed. Please kindly help. Indeed, we never give up since we are fighting for good of our country as our present leaders are bad. 
Here is the help we urgently needed from you, we have in our custody the sum of Nine million four hundred and twenty one dollar. 9.421.000 million,dollar, with 103 kg of gold. i need your help to bank this in your account as i can not go out nor operate any account.
