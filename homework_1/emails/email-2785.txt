REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE & STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I AM MR GANDU AYUBA, I AM AN ACCOUNTANT WITH THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM 
CORPORATION (N.N.P.C.). I HEADED A SEVEN-MAN TENDERS BOARD IN CHARGE OF 
CONTRACT AWARDS AND PAYMENT APPROVALS. I CAME TO KNOW OF YOU IN MY SEARCH 
FOR A RELIABLE AND REPUTABLE PERSON TO HANDLE A VERY CONFIDENTIAL 
TRANSACTION WHICH INVOLVES THE TRANSFER OF A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO A FOREIGN 
ACCOUNT.

THERE WERE SERIES OF CONTRACTS EXECUTED BY A CONSORTIUM OF MULTI-NATIONALS 
IN THE OIL INDUSTRY IN FAVOUR OF N.N.P.C. THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF THIS 
CONTRACTS WERE DELIBERATELY OVER- INVOICED TO THE SUM OF USD$30,000,000.00 
(THIRTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS).

THIS AMOUNT HAS  BEEN APPROVED AND IS NOW READY TO BE TRANSFERRED, BEING 
THAT THE COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY EXECUTED THESE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN FULLY 
PAID AND THE PROJECTS OFFICIALLY COMMISSIONED.CONSEQUENTLY, MY COLLEAGUES 
AND I ARE WILLING TO TRANSFER THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO YOUR ACCOUNT FOR 
SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENT, SINCE WE, CIVIL SERVANTS ARE PROHIBITED BY THE CODE 
OF CONDUCT BUREAU (CIVIL SERVICE LAW) FROM OPERATING AND/OR OPENING FOREIGN 
ACCOUNTS IN OUR NAMES. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE TRUST REPOSED ON YOU AT THIS 
JUNCTURE IS ENORMOUS. IN RETURN, WE HAVE AGREED TO OFFER YOU 25% OF THE 
TRANSFERRED SUM, WHILE 10% SHALL BE SET ASIDE FOR INCIDENTAL EXPENSES 
(INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL) BETWEEN PARTIES IN THE COURSE OF THE TRANSACTION. 
YOU WILL BE MANDATED TO REMIT THE BALANCE TO OTHER ACCOUNTS IN DUE COURSE.

MODALITIES HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE MINISTRY OF 
FINANCE AND THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (C.B.N.) FOR THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER 
OF THE
FUNDS WITHIN 14 WORKING DAYS SUBJECT TO YOUR SATISFACTION OF THE ABOVE 
STATED TERMS. OUR ASSURANCE IS THAT YOUR ROLE IS RISK FREE.

TO ACCORD THIS TRANSACTION THE LEGALITY IT DESERVES AND FOR MUTUAL SECURITY 
OF THE FUNDS THE WHOLE APPROVAL PROCEDURES WILL BE OFFICIALLY AND LEGALLY
PROCESSED WITH YOUR NAME OR THE NAME OF ANY COMPANY YOU MAY NOMINATE AS THE 
BONAFIDE BENEFICIARY.

ONCE MORE, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT HAVING PUT IN OVER TEN YEARS IN THE 
CIVIL SERVICE OF MY COUNTRY, I AM AVERSE TO HAVING MY IMAGE AND CAREER 
DENTED. THIS
MATTER SHOULD THEREFORE BE TREATED WITH THE UTMOST SECRECY AND URGENCY IT 
DESERVES.

KINDLY EXPEDITE ACTION AS WE ARE BEHIND SCHEDULE TO ENABLE US CONCLUDE THIS 
TRANSFER.

THANKS FOR YOUR ANTICIPATED CO-OPERATION.

YOURS SINCERELY,
MR GANDU AYUBA
